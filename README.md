# Description 
The “Tempered Training: Poisoning-Resistant Federated Learning for Blockchain (TT-FL-B)” project implements a secure federated learning framework specifically designed for blockchain applications. It leverages Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanisms to ensure model robustness against malicious actors attempting to manipulate training data. By enabling secure and decentralized training across multiple participants, this project empowers blockchain systems with enhanced learning capabilities while preserving data privacy.
